#que
Write a program to receive a number and check whether it is twoâ€™s power or not? In mathematics, a power of two is a number of the form 2^n where n is an integer, i.e. the result of exponentiation with number two as the base and integer n as the exponent. ... Because two is the base of the binary numeral system, powers of two are common in computer science.
