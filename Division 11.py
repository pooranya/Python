Write a program to divide two numbers, print the quotient and remainder – without the division operation ?

Division is one of the basic arithmetic operations; each part of a division equation has a name. The three main names are the dividend, the divisor, and the quotient. a. Dividend - The dividend is the number you are dividing up b. Divisor - The divisor is the number you are dividing by c. Quotient - The quotient is the answer d. Remainder – The left over after the division, the group that is incomplete Dividend ÷ Divisor = Quotient + Remainder
